# Handwriting-Recoginition-Using-Python
It is a a python program through which you can give any input as an image and with 95% accuracy it will give you the optimal result.
Handwriting recognition using Python is a process of digitizing handwritten text into machine-encoded text. The task is accomplished through image processing techniques, where an image of handwritten text is captured, pre-processed, and then passed through a recognition algorithm. With the help of Python, a high accuracy of 95% can be achieved in handwriting recognition.

The handwriting recognition system first preprocesses the image by removing noise, skew correction, and binarization. The preprocessed image is then segmented into individual characters, and features are extracted from each character. These features may include the number of strokes, the angles between strokes, and the position of each stroke.

After feature extraction, a machine learning algorithm is used to classify each character based on its features. One such algorithm that can be used is the Support Vector Machine (SVM), which is a supervised learning algorithm that can be trained with labeled data to recognize patterns in the input data.

To achieve a high accuracy of 95%, a large dataset of handwritten text samples is required for training the machine learning algorithm. The dataset should be diverse and include a variety of handwriting styles, letter formations, and writing sizes.

The benefits of handwriting recognition using Python include automation of data entry, improved accessibility for people with disabilities, and the ability to digitize historical documents that may not be available in electronic format. With a 95% accuracy rate, the system can be used for a range of applications such as digitizing handwritten letters, translating handwriting to text, and even recognizing signatures.
